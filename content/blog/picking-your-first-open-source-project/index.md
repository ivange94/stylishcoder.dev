So you've decided you want to contribute to open source. Maybe someone told you it'll help you build your skills or it's a school assignment or you're just bored or your employer requires you to. Whatever your motivation, you've made the right choice in contributing to open source and in reading this blog :wink:.



### Motivation is the key

Your motivation for contributing to open source may not only determine which project you start with but also how far you're willing to go.

Contributing to open source may be hard. Not necessarily technically hard. I mean been able to bring your self to write a lot of code for free might be hard without the right motivation.

In open source you will be writing free software. Your are not always going to be appreciated for it. Sometimes some users will be rude and unappreciative of the free work. You might even find it getting between your job or your school. That's why a strong motivation is key to pulling through this awesome journey you've decided to take.



### So what is your motivation?

The next section I will divide my tips amongst different motivations. 

I believe there must be a lot of reasons for someone to want to contribute to open source. Here I'll share different motivations based on my own experiences as a developer and those of some open source contributors I've encounted.



### You want to do Google Summer of Code

If you're a student then this is a great motivation. This was my motivation when I decided to contribute to open source back in 2015. **Google Summer of Code**(GSoC) is an open source internship organized by Google where students are paid a stipend to code on open source projects.

Money aside, participating in programs like GSoC is a really rewarding experience. You get to learn from a lot of experienced people and at the same time do something for the community.

Picking your first project as a student interested in participating in GSoC, I would start with the GSoC website https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/.

You can search for projects based on your field of interest. There's a categories query with categories like Cloud, Databases, Games, Security, Development tools, etc. 

There's also a search box if you don't find the filter very helpful. In the search box you can find projects by programming languages. That's how I did it. I just searched for projects that used Java.

GSoC is not the only open source internship out there. There are others like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), [KDE internships](https://season.kde.org/), etc. For a list of some of these programs visit https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Open-Source-Programs.

You could use the following checklist in picking projects

* Which language are you good at or which language do you want to master?
* Which field of work really excites you? Is it web development, game programming or security? You only can answer this. 
* Which technology do you think will be easy to get support locally. If you pick something that a lot of people in your community are working with then you stand a higher chance of success as help is not so far. This also means you might get meet ups around that language or field.
* What is my schools curriculum? What project will help me most as a student?
* How friendly is the community? Do they have helpful documentations? Do they make an effort in on-boarding beginners? Some organizations have issues tagged for beginners and also have very good guides for beginners. I did enjoy [Coala's](https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Newcomers_Guide.html) effort in documentation and made contributing a breeze. Some organizations even have mentorship programs for newcomers. 

When you visit an organization, always look for links like **Get Involved**, **Contributing**, or something similar.



### You're a beginner but not a student 

GSoC is strictly for students but there are other programs available that are open to non-students like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/).

Go to websites of these programs to get more information about participating projects.

If you're not bent on participating in any of those programs and just want to contribute, then I'll recommend https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners. It's a list of open source projects that are beginner friendly.



### You're an experienced engineer looking for something to do over the weekends

Go with a tool you use at work. If you use Elastic Search, try contributing to the project. If you use Ansible, try making some enhancements or fix some bugs. This way you're helping the community and indirectly adding value to your company as you build more knowledge in this tool and also may use the new features you introduce while working for your company.

Open source is run by mostly volunteers and sometimes a tool you use at work may have a bug that's a blocker. You don't have to wait for the maintainers to fix this. You could make a PR for this. And if you've already fixed this internally, consider making a PR to the project on GitHub so that the rest of the community can benefit.



### How Larry picks his projects

Who is Larry? 

Larry is the author of this blog and also a software engineer. Larry likes giving conference talks and this single factor determines how he picks his projects :laughing:

I pick a project with a large community around it because this increases the chances of having a lot of conferences around that project project or idea.



I really hope this helps you in your journey to contribute to open source. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reachout on Twitter [@stylishcoder](https://twitter.com/stylishcoder).
