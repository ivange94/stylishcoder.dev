> **NOTE**: This blog post is ported from my wordpress blog I wrote 3 years ago. There's a lot I would write differently given my experience so far. I made a few modifications but did not want to do a complete rewrite. If you find something offensive or inaccurate, please know this is an old blog post and my views might have changed.  



At [SMCONF16](https://smconf.org/) which was on the 18th of June 2016, I saw a lot of skepticism from people especially students about getting involved with open source projects. Their concerns were centered around the point, **"How do you make money from it, if you give it for free?"**

There are obviosly a lot of benefits to anyone contributing to open source projects but this blog post is targeted towards students and especially the ones in a computer science related field of study.

I think the most valuable asset of been part of an open source project is the experience and skills you'll acquire. Not everything can be taught in class. Open source gives you the opportunity to practice and master software engineering skills taught in class and even learn new things. These include communication skills, project management skills, leadership skills and how to work in teams. You'll also learn how to use popular software engineering tools like git. Experience gained from open source will help you in your future jobs sicne most of the tools used in open source projects will be the same you'll use in your jobs. In open source you get to learn from very talented people who are also volunteering their time to create software and mentor others. You also get to learn about things like conventions and culture of a community. You might be good at writing code but if you don't follow a communities culture, you'll not go very far in that community.

We usually need internships to master what was taught in class and also learn new things. But getting an internship to work on what you love doing is not very easy. Considering the fact that our environment is made of mostly startups and very little or no giant tech companies, our options for internships are limited because of these startups will not do what you want. That is, the work that the startup is investing in may not be of interest to you. For example, one of my friends would love to do his internship on Artificial Intelligence but how many startups can be found doing that in Cameroon? As a startup, I want to start making money fast so that I can pay my bills, pay my developers and also get something from it. Hence I will always go for the thing that will make it to the market very fast and start selling. As a result most startups do only web development and mobile development using Ionic(if they do any mobile programming at all) since these are easier and can make it to the market very fast due to the large number of tools around to make this easy. But not everyone wants to be building websites and hybrid apps. With open source, you have the liberty to choose what you want to work on. There are open sourc projects for almost any computer sicnece related field of study like; web development, database, compilers, systems programming, networking, etc. Hence finding what you love to work on is just a matter of few google searches.

Your open source contributions will increase your chances of getting your dream job. When you contribute to an open source project, you don't need to tell employers what you've done. You just tell them to Google search your name(*That was a joke. You obviously have to tell them even if they already know*). I guess my point is that your reputation as an open source developer will always precede you. Most of our dream jobs will require an experience  level of at least 2 years. But after you just graduate, that is something you may lack. But you can make up for that by working on big open source projects while you're still a student.

Open source will connect you to the right people. While working on open source projects you get to make a lot of friends. Friends that will give you good career advices and also connect you with interesting opportinuties. You will be talking with people that others can only read about on the Internet.

That been said, open source is not only about learning and meeting people or increasing your chances of getting jobs. As a student, you can actually make a lot of money as an open source developer. A lot of you are familiar with [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)(GSoC) program where Google pays students upto $3000 to work on open source projects. Imagine getting paid that much as a student to work on something you  ðŸ’–. GSoC is not the only open source internship out there. You can see more of such internships from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Open-Source-Programs). The open source communities you contribute to may also end up employing you.

There are obviously a lot more benefits to contributing to open source projects. But if the above don't inspire you, then there's no need for me to continue further. For those of you that have been inspired, I encourage you to go to [opensource.com](opensource.com) and learn about new and interesting projects. Browse projects on GitHub. And feel free to reach out on on Twitter with questions you have about getting started with open source.
